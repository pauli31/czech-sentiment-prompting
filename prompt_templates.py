Category 1 - positive: Includes reviews that are satisfied with the movie or TV show.

Category 2 - neutral: Includes reviews that are mixed or do not significantly express any sentiment.

Category 3 - negative: Includes reviews that are dissatisfied with the movie or TV show.

The text for analysis will be marked with four slashes, i.e., ////.

Step 1:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} Judge the overall mood of the text and determine which category the text most likely belongs to.
Step 2:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} Focus more closely on the keywords used in the text. Check if the keywords suggest a specific category.
For instance, if the text extensively praises the movie or TV show, you should choose "Positive". If the review is mixed or ambiguous, choose "Neutral". If the text criticizes the movie or TV show, choose "Negative".
Step 3:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} Determine the final category based on the highest probability.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} <rationale for Step 1>
Step 2:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} <rationale for Step 2>
Step 3:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} <rationale for Step 3>
User's answer:{PROMPT_DELIMITER} <the evaluated sentiment itself>

Ensure that you are inserting {PROMPT_DELIMITER} to separate each step.
